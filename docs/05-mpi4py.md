# Message Passing Interface {.section}

# Message passing interface

- MPI is an application programming interface (API) for communication
  between separate processes
- MPI programs are portable and scalable
    - the same program can run on different types of computers, from PC's
      to supercomputers
    - the most widely used approach for distributed parallel computing
- MPI is flexible and comprehensive
    - large (over 300 procedures)
    - concise (often only 6 procedures are needed)
- MPI standard defines C and Fortran interfaces
    - MPI for Python (mpi4py) provides an unofficial Python interface


# Processes and threads

![](img/processes-threads-mpi.png)

FIXME: missing figure

<div class="column">

## Process

- Independent execution units
- Have their own state information and *own memory* address space

</div>
<div class="column">

## Thread

- A single process may contain multiple threads
- Have their own state information, but *share* the *same memory*
  address space

</div>


# Execution model

- MPI program is launched as a set of *independent*, *identical processes*
    - execute the same program code and instructions
    - can reside in different nodes (or even in different computers)
- The way to launch a MPI program depends on the system
    - mpirun, mpiexec, aprun, srun,...
    - aprun on sisu.csc.fi, srun on taito.csc.fi


# MPI rank

- Rank: ID number given to a process
    - it is possible to query for rank
    - processes can perform different tasks based on their rank

```python
if (rank == 0):
    # do something
elif (rank == 1):
    # do something else
else:
    # all other processes do something different
```


# Data model

- Each MPI process has its own *separate* memory space, i.e. all
  variables and data structures are *local* to the process
- Processes can exchange data by sending and receiving messages

FIXME: missing figure


# MPI communicator

- Communicator: a group containing all the processes that will participate
  in communication
    - in mpi4py most MPI calls are implemented as methods of a
    communicator object
    - `MPI_COMM_WORLD` contains all processes (`MPI.COMM_WORLD` in
    mpi4py)
    - user can define custom communicators


# Routines in MPI for Python

- Communication between processes
    - sending and receiving messages between two processes
    - sending and receiving messages between several processes
- Synchronization between processes
- Communicator creation and manipulation
- Advanced features (e.g. user defined datatypes, one-sided communication
  and parallel I/O)


# Getting started

- Basic methods of communicator object
    - `Get_size()` Number of processes in communicator
    - `Get_rank()` rank of this process

```python
from mpi4py import MPI

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD # communicator object containing all processes

size = comm.Get_size()
rank = comm.Get_rank()

print("I am rank %d in group of %d processes" % (rank, size))
```


# Running an example program

```bash
$ mpirun -np 4 python3 hello.py

I am rank 2 in group of 4 processes
I am rank 0 in group of 4 processes
I am rank 3 in group of 4 processes
I am rank 1 in group of 4 processes
```

```python
from mpi4py import MPI

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD # communicator object containing all processes

size = comm.Get_size()
rank = comm.Get_rank()

print("I am rank %d in group of %d processes" % (rank, size))
```


# Point-to-Point Communication {.section}

# MPI communication

- MPI processes are independent, they communicate to coordinate work
- Point-to-point communication
    - Messages are sent between two processes
- Collective communication
    - Involving a number of processes at the same time

FIXME: missing figure


# MPI point-to-point operations

- One process *sends* a message to another process that *receives* it
- Sends and receives in a program should match - one receive per send


# Sending and receiving data

- Sending and receiving a dictionary

```python
from mpi4py import MPI

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD # communicator object containing all processes
rank = comm.Get_rank()

if rank == 0:
    data = {'a': 7, 'b': 3.14}
    comm.send(data, dest=1)
elif rank == 1:
    data = comm.recv(source=0)
```


# Sending and receiving data

- Arbitrary Python objects can be communicated with the send and
  receive methods of a communicator

<div class="column">

`.send(data, dest)`
  : `data`{.input}
    : Python object to send

    `dest` {.input}
    : destination rank

</div>
<div class="column">

`.recv(source)`
  : `source`{.input}
    : source rank
    : note: data is provided as return value

</div>

- Destination and source ranks have to match!


# Blocking routines & deadlocks

- `send()` and `recv()` are *blocking* routines
    - the functions exit only once it is safe to use the data (memory)
    involved in the communication
- Completion depends on other processes => risk for *deadlocks*
    - for example, if all processes call `recv()` there is no-one left to
    call a corresponding `send()` and the program is *stuck forever*


# Typical point-to-point communication patterns

- Incorrect ordering of sends and receives may result in a deadlock

FIXME: missing figure


# Case study: parallel sum

- Array originally on process #0 (P0)
- Parallel algorithm
  1. Scatter
    - Half of the array is sent to process 1
  2. Compute
    - P0 & P1 sum independently their segments
  3. Reduction
    - Partial sum on P1 sent to P0
    - P0 sums the partial sums

FIXME: missing figure


# Case study: parallel sum

- Step 1.1: Receive operation in scatter
    - P1 posts a receive to receive half of the array from P0

FIXME: missing figure


# Case study: parallel sum

- Step 1.2: Send operation in scatter
    - P0 posts a send to send the lower part of the array to P1

FIXME: missing figure


# Case study: parallel sum

- Step 2: Compute the sum in parallel
    - P0 & P1 computes their parallel sums and store them locally

FIXME: missing figure


# Case study: parallel sum

- Step 3.1: Receive operation in reduction
    - P0 posts a receive to receive partial sum

FIXME: missing figure


# Case study: parallel sum

- Step 3.2: send operation in reduction
    - P1 posts a send with partial sum

FIXME: missing figure


# Case study: parallel sum

- Step 3.3: compute final answer
    - P0 sums the partial sums

FIXME: missing figure


# Communicating NumPy arrays

- Arbitrary Python objects are converted to byte streams (pickled) when
  sending and back to Python objects (unpickled) when receiving
    - these conversions may be a serious overhead to communication
- Contiguous memory buffers (such as NumPy arrays) can be communicated
  with very little overhead using upper case methods:
    - `Send(data, dest)`
    - `Recv(data, source)`
    - note the difference in receiving: the data array has to exist at the
    time of call


# Send/receive a NumPy array

- Note the difference between upper/lower case!
    - send/recv: general Python objects, slow
    - Send/Recv: continuous arrays, fast

```python
from mpi4py import MPI
import numpy

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()

if rank == 0:
    data = numpy.arange(100, dtype=float)
    comm.Send(data, dest=1)
elif rank == 1:
    data = numpy.empty(100, dtype=float)
    comm.Recv(data, source=0)
```


# Combined send and receive

- Send one message and receive another with a single command
    - reduces risk for deadlocks
- Destination and source ranks can be same or different
    - `MPI.PROC_NULL` can be used for *no destination/source*

```python
# send buffer
data = numpy.arange(10, dtype=float) * (rank + 1)
# receive buffer
buffer = numpy.empty(10, float)

if rank == 0:
    dest, source = 1, 1
elif rank == 1:
    dest, source = 0, 0

comm.Sendrecv(data, dest=dest, recvbuf=buffer, source=source)
```


# MPI datatypes

- MPIÂ has a number of predefined datatypes to represent data
    - e.g. `MPI.INT` for integer and `MPI.DOUBLE` for float
- No need to specify the datatype for Python objects or Numpy arrays
    - objects are serialised as byte streams
    - automatic detection for NumPy arrays
- If needed, one can also define custom datatypes
    - for example to use non-contiguous data buffers

# Summary

- Point-to-point communication = messages are sent between two MPI
  processes
- Point-to-point operations enable any parallel communication pattern (in
  principle)
- Arbitrary Python objects (that can be pickled!)
    - `send` / `recv`
    - `sendrecv`
- Memory buffers such as Numpy arrays
    - `Send` / `Recv`
    - `Sendrecv`


# Non-blocking Communication {.section}

# Non-blocking communication

- Non-blocking sends and receives
    - `isend` & `irecv`
    - returns immediately and sends/receives in background
    - return value is a Request object
- Enables some computing concurrently with communication
- Avoids many common dead-lock situations


# Non-blocking communication

- Have to finalize send/receive operations
    - `wait()`
        - Waits for the communication started with `isend` or `irecv` to
          finish (blocking)
    - `test()`
        - Tests if the communication has finished (non-blocking)
- You can mix non-blocking and blocking p2p routines
    - e.g., receive `isend` with `recv`


# Typical usage pattern

<div class="column">

```python
request = comm.Irecv(ghost_data)

request2 = comm.Isend(border_data)

compute(ghost_independent_data)

request.wait()

compute(border_data)
```

</div>
<div class="column">

FIXME: missing figure

</div>


# Non-blocking send/receive

- Interleaving communication and computation

```python
rank = comm.Get_rank()
size = comm.Get_size()

if rank == 0:
    data = arange(size, dtype=float) * (rank + 1)
    req = comm.Isend(data, dest=1)    # start a send
    calculate_something(rank)         # .. do something else ..
    req.wait()                        # wait for send to finish
    # safe to read/write data again

elif rank == 1:
    data = empty(size, float)
    req = comm.Irecv(data, source=0)  # post a receive
    calculate_something(rank)         # .. do something else ..
    req.wait()                        # wait for receive to finish
    # data is now ready for use
```


# Multiple non-blocking operations

- Methods `waitall()` and `waitany()` may come handy when dealing with
  multiple non-blocking operations (available in the `MPI.Request` class)
    - `Request.waitall(requests)`
        - wait for all initiated requests to complete
    - `Request.waitany(requests)`
        - wait for any initiated request to complete

```python
from mpi4py.MPI import Request

data = numpy.arange(10, dtype=float) * (rank + 1)  # send buffer
buffer = numpy.empty(10, float)                    # receive buffer

if rank == 0:
    req = [comm.Isend(data, dest=1))]
    req.append(comm.Irecv(buffer, source=1))
Request.waitall(req)
```


# Summary

- Non-blocking communication is usually the smart way to do point-to-point
  communication in MPI
- Non-blocking communication realization
    - `isend` / `Isend`
    - `irecv` / `Irecv`
    - `request.wait()`


# Communicators {.section}

# Communicators

FIXME: missing figure


# User-defined communicators

- By default a single, universal communicator exists to which all
  processes belong (`MPI.COMM_WORLD`)
- One can create new communicators, e.g. by splitting this into
  sub-groups

```python
comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()

color = rank % 4

local_comm = comm.Split(color)
local_rank = local_comm.Get_rank()

print("Global rank: %d Local rank: %d" % (rank, local_rank))
```


# Collective Communication {.section}

# Collective communication

- Collective communication transmits data among all processes in a process
  group (communicator)
    - these routines must be called by all the processes in the group
    - amount of sent and received data must match
- Collective communication includes
    - data movement
    - collective computation
    - synchronization
- Example
    - `comm.barrier()` makes every task hold until all tasks in the
      communicator `comm` have called it


# Collective communication

- Collective communication typically outperforms point-to-point
  communication
- Code becomes more compact (and efficient!) and easier to maintain:
    - For example, communicating a Numpy array of 1M elements from task 0 to all
      other tasks:

<div class="column">

```python
if rank == 0:
    for i in range(1, size):
    comm.Send(data, i)
else:
    comm.Recv(data, 0)
```

</div>
<div class="column">

```python
comm.Bcast(data, 0)
```

</div>


# Broadcasting

- Send the same data from one process to all the other

FIXME: missing figure


# Broadcasting

- Broadcast sends same data to all processes

```python
from mpi4py import MPI
import numpy

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()

if rank == 0:
    py_data = {'key1' : 0.0, 'key2' : 11}  # Python object
    data = np.arange(8) / 10.              # NumPy array
else:
    py_data = None
    data = np.zeros(8)

new_data = comm.bcast(py_data, root=0)

comm.Bcast(data, root=0)
```


# Scattering

- Send equal amount of data from one process to others
- Segments A, B, ... may contain multiple elements

FIXME: missing figure


# Scattering

- Scatter distributes data to processes

```python
from mpi4py import MPI
from numpy import arange, empty

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()
size = comm.Get_size()
if rank == 0:
    py_data = range(size)
    data = arange(size**2, dtype=float)
else:
    py_data = None
    data = None

new_data = comm.scatter(py_data, root=0)  # returns the value

buffer = empty(size, float)         # prepare a receive buffer
comm.Scatter(data, buffer, root=0)  # in-place modification
```


# Gathering

- Collect data from all the process to one process
- Segments A, B, ... may contain multiple elements

FIXME: missing figure


# Gathering

- Gather pulls data from all processes

```python
from mpi4py import MPI
from numpy import arange, zeros

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()
size = comm.Get_size()

data = arange(10, dtype=float) * (rank + 1)
buffer = zeros(size * 10, float)

n = comm.gather(rank, root=0) # returns the value

comm.Gather(data, buffer, root=0) # in-place modification
```


# Reduce operation

- Applies an operation over set of processes and places result in
  single process

FIMXE: missing figure


# Reduce operation

- Reduce gathers data and applies an operation on it

```python
from mpi4py import MPI
from numpy import arange, empty

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()
size = comm.Get_size()

data = arange(10 * size, dtype=float) * (rank + 1)
buffer = zeros(size * 10, float)

n = comm.reduce(rank, op=MPI.SUM, root=0) # returns the value

comm.Reduce(data, buffer, op=MPI.SUM, root=0) # in-place modification
```


# Other common collective operations

Scatterv
  : each process receives different amount of data

Gatherv
  : each process sends different amount of data

Allreduce
  : all processes receive the results of reduction

Alltoall
  : each process sends and receives to/from each other

Alltoallv
  : each process sends and receives different amount of data to/from
    each other


# Non-blocking collectives

- New in MPI 3: no support in mpi4py
- Non-blocking collectives enable the overlapping of communication and
  computation together with the benefits of collective communication
- Restrictions
    - have to be called in same order by all ranks in a communicator
    - mixing of blocking and non-blocking collectives is not allowed


# Non-blocking collectives

FIXME: missing figure

- NOT SUPPORTED by MPI for Python


# Common mistakes with collectives

- Using a collective operation within one branch of an if-test of the rank
    - `if rank == 0: comm.bcast(...)`
    - all processes in a communicator must call a collective routine!
- Assuming that all processes making a collective call would complete at
  the same time
- Using the input buffer as the output buffer:
    - `comm.Scatter(a, a, MPI.SUM)`


# Summary

- Collective communications involve all the processes within a
  communicator
    - all processes must call them
- Collective operations make code more transparent and compact
- Collective routines allow optimizations by MPI library
- MPI-3 contains also non-blocking collectives, but these are currently
  not supported by MPI for Python
