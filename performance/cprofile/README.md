## Using cProfile

In this exercise we analyze the performance of heat equation solver with cProfile.

The file [heat_simple.py](heat_simple.py) contains (very inefficient)
implementation of the two dimensional heat equation. Use `cProfile` for
investigating where the time is spent in the program. You can try to profile
also the more efficient model solution of
[numpy/heat-equation](../heat-equation/solution/heat-serial.py).
